## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Omcodes23/Elegance-Jewellery-Website.git
    ```

2.  **Set up your web server:**

    *   Copy the project files to your web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/elegance-jewellery`).

3.  **Configure the database (if applicable):**

    *   **Note:** Detailed database setup instructions are missing.  You'll need to:
        *   Create a MySQL database.
        *   Update the database connection details in relevant PHP files (e.g., `admin/includes/functions.php`, or similar files responsible for database interaction) with your database credentials (host, username, password, database name).  This information is not explicitly provided in the given file structure so you may need to determine the correct files on your own.

4.  **Import the database schema (if applicable):**

    *   **Note:**  A database schema file is missing.  You will need to create the necessary database tables for products, categories, customers, orders, etc.
        *   Import this schema into your MySQL database.

5.  **Access the website:**

    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the website's URL (e.g., `http://localhost/elegance-jewellery`).

6.  **Admin Panel Access:**

    *   Navigate to the admin login page (e.g., `http://localhost/elegance-jewellery/admin-login.php`).
    *   **Note:** Default admin credentials are not provided.  You may need to create an admin user in the database directly.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

This project provides a simple website structure. The JavaScript file 'assets/js/buy-now.js' contains initial code intended to handle a 'buy now' functionality. It selects all elements with the class 'buy-now-btn' and attaches an event listener. Complete implementation for add to cart and checkout functionalities are not specified and need to be implemented.

There is no explicit API documentation as this project appears to be a front-end website with some PHP-based backend functionality for administration.

## Configuration Options

The following aspects of the website can be configured:

*   **CSS Styling:** Modify the `assets/css/style.css` and `assets/css/mobile.css` files to change the website's appearance.
*   **PHP Configuration:**  The admin panel functionality (located in the `admin/` directory) relies on PHP.  You can configure PHP settings in your `php.ini` file.
*   **Database Configuration:**  As described in the "Installation & Setup Instructions" section, you'll need to configure the database connection details in the PHP files.
